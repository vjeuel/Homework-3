<h1><strong>PASSWORD GENERATOR</strong></h1>

<p>Application designed to generate a password every time the user clicks on the Generate Password button.

The application asks the user how many characters he(she) would like to generate and also what type of characters (numbers, lowercase, uppercase or special characters).

If the user selects any number bellow 8 and above 128, an alert will show in the screen, prompting he(she) to try again and type an acceptable number.

In case the user doesn't select at least one type of character an alert asks he(she) to try again since one type of character has to be selected.

I took the liberty to do some styling also and created a grey page using neomorphism.

- Update: Noticed that when the user typed a letter instead of a number the application was rolling normally and at the end it wasn't not printing anything. So I addressed the issue by verifying if not a number and sending an alert for the user to enter a number instead.
